# Javascript by Examples and Unit Tests
This project collects a set of examples for different purposes coupled with unit tests in order to provide a hands-on resource for developers.

As I come cross useful examples to describe various concepts in Javascript, I will develop code, and its corresponding unit tests.

## Setup
You need to run the following command in order to install required packages for this project.
```
yarn install
```
## Start Unit Tests

In order to run tests for specific example, you should issue the following command:

```
yarn test test/js.js
```
For instance, the above command will run unit tests for js module.
